# add-life-to-old-photos
Add Life to Old Photos Add Life to Old Photos is a deep learning project aimed at colorizing grayscale images. It leverages the power of Pix2Pix GAN, Azure, and MLflow to bring old black-and-white photos to life with vibrant colors. The project is deployed using Flask for seamless accessibility.

üöÄ Features Image Colorization: Automatically convert grayscale images to colored ones using a Pix2Pix GAN. End-to-End ML Workflow: Managed and tracked experiments using Azure and MLflow. Web Application: A Flask-based interface to upload grayscale images and get colorized results in real time. Scalable Deployment: Easily deployable architecture leveraging cloud services.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Azure: Cloud platform for hosting and managing the project. MLflow: Experiment tracking and model management. TensorFlow & Keras: Frameworks for building and training the Pix2Pix GAN model. Flask: Web framework for deploying the application. Python: Programming language for the entire workflow.
